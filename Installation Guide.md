#### Bash Script (install_to_all.sh)

```bash
# Install the app on all connected Android devices using ADB
#!/bin/bash

APK_PATH="build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk"

if [ ! -f "$APK_PATH" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå APK not found at $APK_PATH"
  exit 1
fi

echo "üîç Checking connected devices..."
DEVICES=$(adb devices | grep -w "device" | cut -f1)

if [ -z "$DEVICES" ]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  No devices detected via ADB"
  exit 1
fi

for DEVICE in $DEVICES; do
  echo "üì± Installing on $DEVICE ..."
  adb -s "$DEVICE" install -r "$APK_PATH" >/dev/null 2>&1
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Installed successfully on $DEVICE"
  else
    echo "‚ùå Failed to install on $DEVICE"
  fi
echo "üéâ Installation complete on all devices!"
done
```
#### Instructions to Run the Script
1. Save the script as `install_to_all.sh` in your project root.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_to_all.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./install_to_all.sh
   ```
It will cycle through all `adb devices` and install the `.apk`.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ BLE Beacons

Compile and flash the ESP32 firmware using ESP-IDF.
```idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py build
idf.py -p COM3 flash
idf.py monitor
```

---

### üíª Open the ESP-IDF Terminal

To use ESP-IDF with VS Code, you need to open the ESP-IDF terminal. This can be done by running the export script in your terminal.

On Linux or macOS, run:

```bash
cd ~/esp/esp-idf
source export.sh
```
On Windows, you can run the export script from PowerShell or CMD:

  - On Windows PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    . $HOME/espressif/esp-idf/export.ps1
    ```

  - On Windows CMD:

    ```cmd
    %USERPROFILE%\espressif\esp-idf\export.bat
    ```

On Git Bash, run:

   ```bash
   source $HOME/espressif/esp-idf/export.sh
   ```

---

### üîÅ Troubleshooting (if squiggles remain)

- Restart VS Code (or press `Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí Reload Window`)

- Manually reconfigure ESP-IDF menuconfig: press `Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí ESP-IDF: Reconfigure ESP-IDF Project`

- If the IntelliSense still says "cannot open source file...":

  Force a rebuild (Clean and rebuild the project):

  ```idf.py fullclean
  idf.py reconfigure
  idf.py build
  ```
  OR
  
  ```idf.py fullclean
  idf.py reconfigure build
  ```

  OR
  
  delete the `build` folder in your project root and reconfigure again.

- Or clear IntelliSense cache:

  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
  - Choose: `C/C++: Reset IntelliSense Database`

- If you still see issues, try deleting the `.vscode` folder in your project root and reconfigure.
